   <p><em>You should pay attention to key mental events, on a regular and frequent basis, because important thoughts can happen very briefly or very occasionally and you need to catch them.</em></p> 
   <p><em>You may find your understanding of this post significantly improved if you read the third story from <a href="/lw/2aw/seven_shiny_stories">Seven Shiny Stories</a>.</em></p> 
   <p>Luminosity is hard and you are complicated.&nbsp; You can't meditate on yourself for ten minutes over a smoothie and then announce your self-transparency.&nbsp; You have to keep working at it over a long period of time, not least because some effects don't work over the short term.&nbsp; If your affect varies with the seasons, or with major life events, then you'll need to keep up the <em>first</em> phase of work through a full year or a major life event, and it turns out those don't happen every alternate Thursday.&nbsp; Additionally, you can't cobble together the best quality models from snippets of introspection that are each five seconds long; extended strings of cognition are important, too, and can take quite a long time to unravel fully.<br><br>Sadly, looking at what you are thinking inevitably changes it.&nbsp; With enough introspection, this wouldn't influence your accuracy about your overall self - there's no reason in principle why you couldn't spend all your waking hours noting your own thoughts and forming meta-thoughts in real time - but practically speaking that's not going to happen.&nbsp; Therefore, some of your data will have to come from memory.&nbsp; To minimize the error introduction that comes of retrieving things from storage, it's best to arrange to reflect on very recent thoughts.&nbsp; It may be worth your while to set up an external reminder system to periodically prompt you to look inward, both in the moment and retrospectively over the last brief segment of time.&nbsp; This can be a specifically purposed system (i.e. set a timer to go off every half hour or so), or you can tie it to convenient promptings from the world as-is, like being asked "What's up?" or "Penny for your thoughts".<a id="more"></a><br><br>When you introspect, there is a lot to keep track of.&nbsp; For instance, consider the following:</p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>What were you thinking about?&nbsp; (This could be more than one thing.&nbsp; You are a massively parallel system.)&nbsp; Was it a concept, image, sensation, desire, belief, person, object, word, place, emotion, plan, memory...?</li> 
    <li>How tightly were you focused on it?&nbsp; (Is the topic itself narrow or disparate?)&nbsp; What other items (sensory, cognitive, emotional) seemed to intrude on your concentration, if any, and how did you react to this incursion?</li> 
    <li>How did you feel about the subject of the thought?&nbsp; This includes not only emotional reactions like "this is depressing" or "yay!", but also what you felt inclined to do about the topic (if anything), and how important or interesting your thought seemed.</li> 
    <li>How does thinking, in general, feel to you?&nbsp; (I conducted an informal survey of this and got no two answers the same.&nbsp; Anecdotally, it may be rather key to determining how you are different from others, and so in refining your model of yourself relative to the fairly generic <a href="/lw/1xq/let_there_be_light/">priors</a> we're starting with.)&nbsp; Coming up with a good way to conceptualize your style of thinking can help you interpret introspective data, although be sure to abandon a metaphor that looks about to snap.&nbsp; You might have different answers when you're "actively" thinking something through - i.e. when novel information is generated in your mind - and when you're thinking "passively", as when you read or listen to some information and absorb its content as it comes.</li> 
    <li>What memories did the thought dredge up, if any - parallel situations from the past, apparently unrelated anecdotes that floated by for no reason, events where you learned concepts key to the topic of your thought?&nbsp; Did the thought generate anticipations for the future - a plan, a fear, a hope, an expectation, a worry?</li> 
    <li>What sensory input were you receiving at the time?&nbsp; Include not only sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste, but also things like temperature, proprioception, and internal symptoms like hunger or nausea.&nbsp; Can you determine how, if at all, that interacted with the thought?</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p><br>You cannot have too much data.&nbsp; (You probably can have too much data in one situation relative to how much you have in another, though - that'll overbalance your models - so make a concerted effort to diversify your times and situations for introspection.)&nbsp; When you acquire the data, <a href="/lw/1y0/the_abcs_of_luminosity/">correlate it</a> to learn more about what might bring various aspects of your thought into being.</p>

  <p>The first scientific psychologist on the planet was probably named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Wundt" rel="nofollow">Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt</a>. He created a laboratory in Leipzig 130 years ago (about 20 years after Darwin published "Origin of Species") to scientifically study in internally accessible elements of mental life, taking into account the physiology of the body. My limited understanding of his methods are that his "experimental subjects" were specialists who were highly trained in (1) something like "luminosity" and (2) a technical vocabulary for <em>talking about</em> their introspection.</p> 
  <p>This research program seems to have had very little effect on the english speaking world. There were few translations. Some of the early stuff may well have been mistranslations. In later decades this research program may have been the "old paradigm" that behaviorists were reacting against when they were going crazy with claims that their own work was "totally reproducible" by virtue of making no reference whatsoever to "internal states of mind"?</p> 
  <p>If anyone is inclined to <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1ul/for_progress_to_be_by_accumulation_and_not_by/">read the classics and make accumulative progress</a> the barriers to entry may be substantial... But if anyone is interested, the place to start might be <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWilhelm_Wundt&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en" rel="nofollow">the autotranslation of the german wikipedia article about Wundt</a>, and then there seem to be a few translated books on Amazon by Wundt including:</p>

  <p>When I'm tired, it's like talking in my head. When I'm really productive, it's partly non-verbal; it feels as if I'm dealing directly with concepts. The difference is kind of like putting one foot in front of the other versus walking.</p>

  <p>Just realized when thinking about this that I probably go too fast from "what do I observe" to "I ought to be doing something".</p> 
  <p>I've also noticed a while ago that my self-observation was entangled with "Is what I'm feeling or doing good enough?" Sometimes the answer was yes, but I'm pretty sure observation and evaluation need to be sorted out.</p>

  <p>Cross-posted from <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/2aw/seven_shiny_stories/">Seven Shiny Stories</a></p> 
  <p><strong>3. Text</strong></p> 
  <p>Dot reads about an experiment in which the subjects receive phone calls at random times and must tell researchers how happy they feel. Apparently the experiment turned up some really suboptimal patterns of behavior, and Dot's curious about what she'd learn that she could use to improve her life. She gets a friend to arrange delayed text messages to be sent to her phone at intervals supplied by a random number generator, and promises herself that she'll note what she's doing, thinking, and feeling at the moment she receives the text. She soon finds that she doesn't enjoy watching TV as much as she thinks she does; that it's probably worth the time to cook dinner rather than heating up something in the microwave because it's considerably tastier; that she can't really stand her cubicle neighbor; and that she thinks about her ex more than she'd have ever admitted. These thoughts were usually too fleeting to turn into actions; if she tried to remember them hours later, they'd be folded into some large story in which these momentary emotions were secondary. But treating them as notable data points to be taken into account gives them staying power. Dot starts keeping the TV remote under the book she's reading to remind herself what entertainment is more fulfilling. She buys fewer frozen meals and makes sure she's stocked up on staple ingredients. She agrees to swap cubicles with a co-worker down the hall. There's not all that much she can do about the ex, but at least when her friends ask her if everything's okay between them, she can answer more accurately.</p>

  <p>I'm interested in the rest of the sequence, and I voted this one up.</p> 
  <p>I think one thing that made it sound unattractive is that it's describing a lot of work without anything specific about what you've gained by being more luminous. You mention some achievements in the first post, but not what in particular you found out and how you used it to make positive changes.</p> 
  <p>I'm intrigued that a lot of the work I've done has been about being more conscious in the present rather than trying to track the origins of thoughts-- I am more conscious in the present than I was, but I may have missed a valuable angle on the work.</p>

  <p>Like talking to myself. However, when I'm trying to learn something new, I often imagine myself trying to explain the subject matter to some intelligent stand-in, which I usually imagine is my sister.</p> 
  <p>Also, when I'm lost in reverie, I usually get a mild feeling of well-being and contentment.</p>
