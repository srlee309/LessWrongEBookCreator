   <p><em>You may find your understanding of this post significantly improved if you read the sixth story from <a href="/lw/2aw/seven_shiny_stories">Seven Shiny Stories</a>.</em><br><br>When grappling with the complex web of traits and patterns that is you, you are reasonably likely to find yourself <a href="/lw/1mu/sorting_out_sticky_brains/">less than completely uniform</a>.&nbsp; You might have several competing perspectives, possess the ability to code-switch between different <a href="/lw/1ty/mental_crystallography/">styles of thought</a>, or even believe outright contradictions.&nbsp; It's bound to make it harder to think about yourself when you find this kind of convolution.<br><br>Unfortunately, we don't have the vocabulary or even the mental architecture to easily think of or describe ourselves (nor other people) as containing such multitudes.&nbsp; The closest we come in typical conversation more resembles descriptions of superficial, vague ambivalence ("I'm sorta happy about it, but kind of sad at the same time!&nbsp; Weird!") than the sort of deep-level muddle and conflict that can occupy a brain.&nbsp; The models of the human psyche that have come closest to approximating this mess are what I call "multi-agent models".&nbsp; (Note: I have no idea how what I am about to describe interacts with actual psychiatric conditions involving multiple personalities, voices in one's head, or other potentially similar-sounding phenomena.&nbsp; I describe multi-agent models as employed by psychiatrically singular persons.)<br><br>Multi-agent models have been around for a long time: in Plato's <em>Republic</em>, he talks about appetite (itself imperfectly self-consistent), spirit, and reason, forming a tripartite soul.&nbsp; He discusses their functions as though each has its own agency and could perceive, desire, plan, and act given the chance (plus the possibility of one forcing down the other two to rule the soul unopposed).&nbsp; Not too far off in structure is the Freudian id/superego/ego model.&nbsp; The notion of the multi-agent self even <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAngelBadAngel">appears in fiction</a> (warning: TV Tropes).&nbsp; It appears to be a surprisingly prevalent and natural method for conceptualizing the complicated mind of the average human being.&nbsp; Of course, talking about it as something to <em>do</em> rather than as a way to push your psychological theories or your notion of the ideal city structure or a dramatization of a moral conflict makes you sound like an insane person.&nbsp; Bear with me - I have data on the usefulness of the practice from more than one outside source.<a id="more"></a><br><br>There is no reason to limit yourself to traditional multi-agent models endorsed by dead philosophers, psychologists, or cartoonists if you find you break down more naturally along some other arrangement.&nbsp; You can have two of you, or five, or twelve.&nbsp; (More than you can keep track of and differentiate is not a recommended strategy - if you're very tempted to go with this many it may be a sign of something unhealthful going on.&nbsp; If a group of them form a reliable coalition it may be best to fold them back into each other and call them one sub-agent, not several.)&nbsp; Stick with a core ensemble or encourage brief cameos of peripheral aspects.&nbsp; Name them descriptively or after structures of the brain or for the colors of the rainbow, as long as you can tell them apart.&nbsp; Talk to yourselves <a href="/lw/1za/the_spotlight/">aloud or in writing</a>, or just think through the interaction if you think you'll get enough out of it that way.&nbsp; Some examples of things that could get their own sub-agents include:</p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>Desires or clusters of desires, be they complex and lofty ("desire for the well being of all living things") or simple and reptilian ("desire for cake")</li> 
    <li>"Inner child" or similar role-like groupings of traits ("professional me", "family-oriented me", "hobbies me")</li> 
    <li>High-order dispositions and principles ("conscience", "neuroticism", "sense of justice")</li> 
    <li>Opinions or viewpoints, either specific to a situation or general trends ("optimism", "outside view", "I should do X")</li> 
    <li>Initially unspecified, gradually-personality-developing sub-agents, if no obvious ones present themselves (named for something less suggestive like cardinal directions or two possible nicknames derived from your name)</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p>By priors picked up from descriptions of various people trying this, you're reasonably likely to identify one of your sub-agents as <a href="/lw/v4/which_parts_are_me/">"you"</a>.&nbsp; In fact, one sub-agent may be <em>solely</em> identified as "you" - it's very hard to shake the monolithic observer experience.&nbsp; This is fine, especially if the "you" sub-agent is the one that <a href="/lw/209/highlights_and_shadows/">endorses or repudiates</a>, but don't let the endorsement and repudiation get out of hand during multi-agent exercises.&nbsp; You have to deal with all of your sub-agents, not just the one(s) you like best, and sub-agents have been known to exhibit manipulative and even vengeful behaviors once given voice - i.e. if you represent your desire for cake as a sub-agent, and you have been thwarting your desire for cake for years, you might find that Desire For Cake is pissed off at Self-Restraint and says mean things thereunto.&nbsp; It will not placate Desire For Cake for you to throw in endorsement behind Self-Restraint while Desire For Cake is just trying to talk to you about your desperate yen for tiramisu.&nbsp; Until and unless you understand Desire For Cake well enough to surgically remove it, you need to work with it.&nbsp; Opposing it directly and with normative censure will be likely to make it angry and more devious in causing you to eat cake.<br><br>A few miscellaneous notes on sub-agents:<br><br>Your sub-agents may surprise you far more than you expect to be surprised by... well... yourself, which is part of what makes this exercise so useful.&nbsp; If you consciously steer the entire dialogue you will not get as much out of it - then you're just writing self-insert fanfiction about the workings of your brain, not actually learning about it.<br><br>Not all of your sub-agents will be "interested" in every problem, and therefore won't have much of relevance to say at all times.&nbsp; (Desire For Cake probably couldn't care less how you act on your date next week until it's time to order dessert.)<br><br>Your sub-agents should not outright&nbsp; lie to each other ("should" in the predictive, not normative, sense - let me know if it turns out yours do), but they may threaten, negotiate, hide, and be genuinely ignorant about themselves.<br><br>Your sub-agents may not all communicate effectively.&nbsp; Having a translation sub-agent handy could be useful, if they are having trouble interpreting each other.<br><br>(Post your ensemble of subagencies in the comments, to inspire others!&nbsp; Write dialogues between them!)</p>

  <p>Great post! Some thoughts/experience I'd like to add:</p> 
  <p>1) <strong>How I got started.</strong> I began using a multiple-sub-agents heuristic for introspection when I stopped thinking of my mind as a point-mass. The brain has physical extent, and there even parts of my brain that I don't much identify with as "me" even though they affect my bodily functioning and behavior. I thought, how might those parts work? How should I treat them? And then, hey, why not treat them like people? They're made of brain, too.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p>By priors picked up from descriptions of various people trying this, you're reasonably likely to identify one of your sub-agents as "you".</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>2) <strong>"I am my executive system."</strong> To avoid losing or constantly changing my sense of self, and to maintain neutrality, I try to identify most strongly with my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions#Miller_.26_Cohen.27s_.282001.29_model" rel="nofollow">executive system</a> (theorized by Miller, Cohen and others to operate primarily in the prefontal cortex). I think of "me" as a team leader who can coordinate the efforts of the rest of my various brain functions toward coherent goals that take into account their individual preferences. For example, sometimes I'll tell my entertainment-seeking-distraction function that it's probably in his best interest to let my productive-ambitious function work and build opportunities so life can be more entertaining on average in the future.</p> 
  <p>3) <strong>An honor system with signalling.</strong> When I strike a deal like that between conflicting functions or "sub-agents", I find it <em>extremely important</em> to honor the deal so the sub-agents continue to trust my leadership. After committing to this as a policy, I've found it unbelievably easier to negotiate inner conflicts, especially akrasia. For example, when I strike a deal between work and (other) entertainment, I commit to the entertainment agent that I will not procrastinate entertainment indefinitely. Then, I indulge on occasion as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_theory" rel="nofollow">signal</a> that I will honor the deal more as I get older.</p> 
  <p>I don't know about the rest of you, but it seems to me that this "honor system with signaling" is absolutely essential to maintaining my own "inner order", and my quality of life has increased dramatically since I adopted it. Of course I can't be sure how it'd work for others, but it's an idea.</p>

  <p>Billy has the chance to study abroad in Australia for a year, and he's so mixed up about it, he can barely think straight. He can't decide if he wants to go, or why, or how he feels about the idea of missing it. Eventually, he decides this would be far easier if all the different nagging voices and clusters of desire were given names and allowed to talk to each other. He identifies the major relevant sub-agents as "Clingyness", which wants to stay in known surroundings; "Adventurer", which wants to seek new experiences and learn about the world; "Obedience to Advisor", which wants to do what Prof. So-and-So recommends; "Academic", who wants to do whatever will make Billy's résumé more impressive to future readers; and "Fear of Spiders", which would happily go nearly anywhere but the home of the Sydney funnelweb and is probably responsible for Billy's spooky dreams. When these voices have a chance to compete with each other, they expose questionable motivations: for instance, Academic determines that Prof. So-and-So only recommends staying at Billy's home institution because Billy is her research assistant, not because it would further Billy's intellectual growth, which reduces the comparative power of Obedience to Advisor. Adventurer renders Fear of Spiders irrelevant by pointing out that the black widow is native to the United States. Eventually, Academic and Adventurer, in coalition, beat out Clingyness (whom Billy is not strongly inclined to identify with), and Billy buys the ticket to Down Under.</p>

  <p>This post should definitely have mentioned Julian Jaynes. ;)</p> 
  <p>Other related material includes Virginia Satir's "Parts party" (<a href="http://www.ayeconference.com/10s12/" rel="nofollow">brief description</a>).</p> 
  <p>One way I recognize my various parts is that they come out to different extents according to the company I keep. When I'm with people whose thinking is sloppy that bugs the hell out of my inner Spock and he comes out swinging. When I'm hanging out with a bunch of rationalists my inner Mysterian screams at every appearance of a Myth of Pure Reason.</p> 
  <p>This can lead to some graceful ways to disagree with people, btw. "Part of me wishes you were right, but my inner Tyler Durden finds that wishy-washy and is making rude comments. How do your arguments stand up to what we know of human nature?" This is <em>much</em> more satisfactory than giving Tyler Durden the run of your mouth and accusing your interlocutor of angelism outright.</p> 
  <p>Plus, it helps to recognize that even if you think your interlocutor is an idiot, they may not be <em>entirely</em> an idiot, just temporarily under the control of an idiotic part.</p> 
  <p>I don't do this as explicitly as the post suggests (and never to the extent of writing dialogue) but the turn of phrase "part of me agrees/disagree" is familiar, and I suspect it turns up in my thoughts from time to time.</p>

  <p>I have two major entities in by mind, My Brain, and Me. My brain is heavily influenced by chemistry, such as tiredness, and blood sugar levels, and does all the thinking. Me is not affected so much by such things. However, Me has a very limited amount of control over my Brain. If Me forces my Brain to do somthing that it really does not want to do, then it will tire out Me and render it more difficult to force my Brain to do something, until Me's control is replenished, which is a slow process. Me has basically no cognitive faculties, and must make my Brain do the thinking, but talking is a free move, and Me is capable of recognizing and commenting on many cognitive biases as my brain thinks. My brain often will listen to these comments and stop following those faulty lines of thought, because my reword center gives it some dopamine when it makes its thoughts less wrong.</p> 
  <p>Possible causes for this lack of control:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>Me is using its power for unnecessary thing all the time, and so when it is needed it is tiered.</li> 
   <li>I have a genetic lack of power for Me to control my Brain. </li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>Solutions:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>If problem 1, I could try to catch Me controlling my Brain unnecessarily, and stop it.</li> 
   <li>Training my inner rat. If problems 1 or 2, I could get the reward center to give my brain dopamine when it does what it should do, so that Me would not have to make it to do as much. Then Me to conserve its strength.</li> 
   <li>Practices. If 1 is true then this has been tried without success, but if not then it may allow Me to increase its strength of control over my Brain. </li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>Additional thoughts:</p> 
  <p>My Brain, which I have been conspiring to subjugate to the will of Me, is what has been writing all this, with very little control from Me, probable because it gets dopamine for ‘making clover plan to defeat enemy’. My brain doesn't know that the enemy it is making the clever plan against is itself. Me knows that writing this it a good thing, and so encourages my brain to be happy when doing this, so that it will try to do it more.</p>

  <p>I disagree! Finding out when we are lying to our 'selves' about either beliefs or values is one of the most valuable outcomes of this exercise. Lying to our selves so that we may more effectively lie to each other is a core human (<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/03/lord-of-the-factories.html">homo hipocritus</a>) skill!</p>

  <p>That reminds me a bit of PJ Eby's list of ways people sometimes do his RMI technique wrong. (PJ, if you're reading this, would you mind if I posted it?&nbsp;I'm referring to the list from page 55 of TTD. I know RMI isn't exactly the same as what Alicorn is talking about, but I think they're probably invoking related or identical mental processes, and some of your tips on not messing it up seem like they'd be helpful here.)</p>

  <p>I haven't had my sub-agents talk much in the past few months, so I'm not completely sure this is accurate. I'm going to bring them out to play again soon, so I may come back and edit if I discover things have changed since they last talked. (I started doing this because I had an important decision to make that I couldn't consult others about. The sub-agents talked for hours. So I brought them out only when I had something really big for them to hash over, and they've never been able to resolve things quickly. Is this usual? Any advice for having more frequent conversations that are shorter and/or multitaskable?)</p> 
  <p>I'd had HP:MOR on my mind when I started doing this, so I started out with the theme of Harry's four house sub-agents, but they deviated a lot from that.</p> 
  <p><strong>Green</strong> ended up the "designated rationalist". It wants to fulfill the others' desires as much as possible, and doesn't really have any of its' own. It's better than the others at reasoning about what will <em>actually</em> happen if we do something, and what's actually true. It doesn't mind saying things that are unpleasant (or else is slow to realize that they're unpleasant - I'm not really sure). It's pretty terrible at being tactful because of that, and because it tends to get mad at the others when they're being self-defeating. Multiple versions of Green will debate with each other to sort out factual/non-normative questions.</p> 
  <p><strong>Red</strong> is my larger-than-life self, I guess. It's <em>trying</em> to focus on what's important, but does so in a naive way. It has big goals (protect everyone, protect friends, and possibly some wannabe-hero-ness), which it's very sure are more important than what the rest of me wants. It tends to forget about practical constraints and fall for logical fallacies, but can correct for that once it's pointed out (usually by Green). It tends to be really shouty and indignant (but that might be because most of my sub-agent conversations happened because Red was frustrated). It does listen to the others, since it's stuck with us.</p> 
  <p><strong>Yellow</strong> is a mix of things, and I'm not completely sure they belong together. Desire for good relationships with the people I know, approval, and having a comfortable life, probably also some other "normal" things. It's pretty good at "empathizing" with the other sub-agents. (Yellow usually translates when Green wants to tell Red something especially uncomfortable.)</p> 
  <p><strong>Blue</strong> was supposed to be a sub-agent, but it rarely participates in conversation. I'm not sure whether the topics we've talked about haven't interested it, or I don't have a Ravenclaw part, or I have one that's not very verbal.</p> 
  <p><strong>"Phoenix"</strong> appeared unexpectedly - basically just a thing in my brain that gets very loud in a nonverbal way when I'm feeling moral horror. This is probably more of a shorthand for describing that feeling, than a sub-agent. Red translates for it, usually just to inform the others of what it's screaming about. It doesn't have a very large role in these conversations.</p> 
  <p>"Myself" mostly acts as a moderator - introducing the topic of conversation, and then occasionally nudging it. Most of what I have to say after the beginning is just yelling at the other sub agents to "be nice". They don't seem to mind, and they do the same thing to each other pretty often. I think "be nice" is mainly serving as a reminder that cooperation is necessary, not a disendorsement.</p> 
  <p>An unexpected benefit was realizing that Green gets control of my mouth sometimes, and usually makes a mess of it. A friend is telling me their problems, and I start analyzing the situation and suggesting solutions very bluntly, when that's not what they wanted. I'm better at realizing when this is happening now, and when I notice myself starting to do it, I call in Yellow to translate (if I have the mental energy for that, it's difficult to do in real conversations), or I tell the person I'm talking to that they're talking to Green (but worded in a way that they'd understand) and ask if they want to proceed. I think doing this has helped me avoid making my friends feel uncomfortable or hurt.</p>

  <p>I have a fear about this. My fear is that by naming and concentrating on sub-agents I'd exacerbate any tendency I might have towards <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder#Therapist_induced" rel="nofollow">Dissociative identity disorder</a>.</p> 
  <p>Does anyone have more data on that, which may allay my fear?</p>

  <p>I've actually been doing this for a while, and I find it really useful. My list of sub-agents is as follows, ones more likely to be endorsed marked with a (+):</p> 
  <p>*Me (executive)</p> 
  <p>*Internal Critic/devil's advocate (2nd executive who takes the opposite position from the first)</p> 
  <p>*Rationalist/scientist (+)</p> 
  <p>*Ambition (+)</p> 
  <p>*Conscience (+)</p> 
  <p>*Optimist (+)</p> 
  <p>*Cynic</p> 
  <p>*Arrogance (frequently rebels against endorsed entities/positions)</p> 
  <p>*Inner adolescent/sense of humor</p> 
  <p>*Immediate desires/drives (akrasia, hunger, libido, etc.)</p> 
  <p>Rather fragmented, but they are hardly ever all there at once. Cynic and Optimist don't show up at the same time, Conscience is often played by one of the executives, and Adolescent rarely has anything to say.</p>

  <blockquote> 
   <p>Talk to yourselves aloud or in writing...</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>This may be out of left field, but I recommend talking to yourself <em>as yourself</em>, rather than as you'd talk to someone else. In other words, cut out any inadvertent signaling in your voice (spoken or imagined). For some this may seem alien or impossible, for others it may be perfectly normal. Still others probably think they do talk to themselves as themselves, but don't.</p> 
  <p>The reason is just the obvious one that interactions with other people are rarely if ever conducted on a purely rational wavelength, and there's no reason to inadvertently carry those extra distractions over into your own self-talk and contemplation. Maybe no one does this - friendly warning just in case.</p>

  <p>Wonderful article. This idea of a "mental chorus" comprised of some combination of descriptive historical components of the self as well as aspirational components seems very rich for examination and experiment. I wonder how thinking in this way can most effectively be combined with mindfulness practice to optimize self-interactions.</p>
