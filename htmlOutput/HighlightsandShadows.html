   <p><em>You may find your understanding of this post significantly improved if you read the fifth story from <a href="/lw/2aw/seven_shiny_stories">Seven Shiny Stories</a>.</em><br><br>As you uncover and understand new things about yourself, you might find that you like some of them, but don't like others.&nbsp; While one would hope that you'd be generally pleased with yourself, it's a rare arrogance or a rarer saintliness that would enable unlimited approval.&nbsp; Fortunately, as promised in <a href="/lw/1xi/you_are_likely_to_be_eaten_by_a_grue/">post two</a>, luminosity can let you determine what you'd like to change as well as what's already present.<br><br>But what to change?<br><br>An important step in the luminosity project is to sort your thoughts and feelings not only by type, <a href="/lw/1y0/the_abcs_of_luminosity/">correlation</a>, strength, etc, but also by <em>endorsement</em>.&nbsp; You endorse those thoughts that you like, find representative of your favorite traits, prefer to see carried into action, and wish to keep intact (at least for the duration of their useful lives).&nbsp; By contrast, you repudiate those thoughts that you dislike, consider indicative of negative characteristics, want to keep inefficacious, and desire to modify or be rid of entirely.<a id="more"></a><br><br>Deciding which is which might not be trivial.&nbsp; You might need to sift through several orders of desire before finally figuring out whether you <a href="/lw/fv/wanting_to_want/">want to want</a> cake, or like liking sleep, or prefer your preference for preferentism.&nbsp; A good place to start is with your macro-level goals and theoretical commitments (e.g., when this preference is efficacious, does it serve your Life Purposeâ„¢, directly or indirectly?&nbsp; if you have firm metaethical notions of right and wrong, is this tendency you have uncovered in yourself one that impels you to do right things?).<br><br>As a second pass, you can work with the information you collected when you correlated your ABCs.&nbsp; How does an evaluated desire makes you feel when satisfied or unsatisfied?&nbsp; Does it cripple you when unsatisfied or improve your performance when satisfied?&nbsp; Are you reliably in a position to satisfy it?&nbsp; If you can't typically satisfy it, would it be easier to change the desire or to change the circumstances that prevent its satisfaction?&nbsp; However, this is a second step.&nbsp; You need to know what affect and behavior are preferable to you before you can judge desires (and other mental activity) relative to what they yield in those departments, and judging affect and behavior is itself an exercise in endorsement and repudiation.<br><br>Knowing what you like and don't like about your mind is a fine thing.&nbsp; Once you have that information, you can put it to direct use immediately - I find it useful to tag many of my expressions of emotion with the words "endorsed" or "non-endorsed".&nbsp; That way, the people around me can use that categorization rather than having to either assume I approve of everything I feel, or layer their own projections of endorsement on top of me.&nbsp; Either would be unreliable and cause people to have poor models of me: I have not yet managed to excise my every unwanted trait, and my patterns of endorsement do not typically map on to the ones that the people around me have or expect me to have.<br><br>Additionally, once you know what you like and don't like about your mind, you can begin to make progress in increasing the ratio of liked to unliked characteristics.&nbsp; People often make haphazard lurches towards trying to be "better people", but when "better" means "lines up more closely with vaguely defined commonsense intuitions about morality", this is not the sort of goal we're at all good at pursuing.&nbsp; Specific projects like being generous or more mindful are a step closer, but the greatest marginal benefit in self-revision comes of figuring out what comes in <em>advance</em> of behaving in a non-endorsed way and heading it off at the pass.&nbsp; (More on this in "Lampshading".)&nbsp; The odds are low that your brain's patterns align closely with conventional virtues well enough for them to be useful targets.&nbsp; It's a better plan to identify what's already present, then endorse or repudiate these pre-sliced thoughts and work on them as they appear instead of sweeping together an unnatural category.</p>

  <p><strong>5. Contradiction</strong></p> 
  <p>Penny knows she's not perfect. In fact, some of her traits and projects seem to outright contradict one another, so she really knows it. She wants to eat better, but she just loves pizza; she's trying to learn anger management, but sometimes people do things that really are wrong and it seems only suitable that she be upset with them; she's working on her tendency to nag her boyfriend because she knows it annoys him, but if he can't learn to put the toilet seat down, maybe he deserves to be annoyed. Penny decides to take a serious look at the contradictions and make decisions about which "side" she's on. Eventually, she concludes that if she's honest with herself, a life without pizza seems bleak and unrewarding; she'll make that her official exception to the rule, and work harder to eat better in every other way without the drag on motivation caused by withholding her one favorite food. On reflection, being angry - even at people who really do wrong things - isn't helping her or them, and so she throws herself into anger management classes with renewed vigor, looking for other, more productive channels to turn her moral evaluation towards. And - clearly - the nagging isn't helping its ostensible cause either. She doesn't endorse that, but she's not going to let her boyfriend's uncivilized behavior slide either. She'll agree to stop nagging when he slips up and hope this inspires him to remember more often.</p>

  <p>(nods) Yeah, I figured this was coming.</p> 
  <p>This is the point where I generally part company with a lot of projects of this sort: I am far more interested in gaining <em>clarity</em> about the various segments of my psyche than I am about enforcing one segment's goals on another segment's.</p> 
  <p>I consider self-awareness something worth pursuing for its own sake, for the fun of it; understanding what I am for the sake of changing it into something else seems... odd.</p> 
  <p>I'm reminded again of my own process of <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/374/gender_identity_and_rationality/31di?c=1">coming out</a>. Sure, Dave the Closeted Bisexual can decide to endorse or repudiate his same-sex attractions, or his opposite-sex attractions, or both, or some other way of slicing the data. But another approach is to accept what is there without trying to change it. In general, I prefer that approach.</p> 
  <p>I have a similar attitude towards akrasia. Yes, parts of me want to get work done, parts of me want to goof off. The usual framing of this is some version of "How can I effectively endorse the former and repudiate the latter?" My own framing of this is some version of "Well, that's interesting."</p> 
  <p>As another example, about six months ago I started writing a novel. I outlined it in detail and wrote about 50kwords of it, then stopped. Various beta readers of mine described this as "writer's block" and were full of suggestions for how to overcome it. I described this as "I don't seem to want to work on this novel any more," and saw no particular reason to overcome it. Perhaps I'll pick it up again some day. Perhaps not.</p> 
  <p>Admittedly, if I became unable to hold down a lucrative job, pursue a rewarding hobby, maintain rewarding personal relationships, etc., I might start feeling differently; it might no longer be acceptable to work on accepting myself as I am without trying to change myself. Then again, I observe that accepting that I am what I am and want what I want and contradict myself where I contradict myself often causes me to be more effective in the world, and I suspect that's not a coincidence.</p> 
  <p>I'm not exactly sure why I'm writing this comment, to be honest, beyond that I was thinking about it in response to this post. I'm certainly not <em>disagreeing</em> with any of what you've written here... the sort of endorsement/repudiation of well-understood aspects of one's psyche that you suggest can work very well, and certainly works better than trying to change things one hasn't yet understood. Nor am I suggesting that my current state is perfect and cannot be improved upon.</p> 
  <p>I guess I'm just articulating a different perspective. Yes, once you've identified what you don't like about your mind, you can work on changing/improving it, as you say. Alternatively, once you've discovered that there are things about your mind you don't like, you can work on being OK with them, just like you can work on being OK with other people's minds without changing them.</p>
