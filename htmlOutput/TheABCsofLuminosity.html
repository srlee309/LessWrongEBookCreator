   <p><em>Affect, behavior, and circumstance interact with each other.&nbsp; These interactions constitute informative patterns that you should identify and use in your luminosity project.</em></p> 
   <p><em>You may find your understanding of this post significantly improved if you read the second story from <a href="/lw/2aw/seven_shiny_stories">Seven Shiny Stories</a>.</em></p> 
   <p>The single most effective thing you can do when seeking luminosity is to learn to correlate your ABC's, collecting data about how three interrelated items interact and appear together or separately.<br><br>A stands for "affect".&nbsp; Affect is how you feel and what's on your mind.&nbsp; It can be far more complicated than "enh, I'm fine" or "today I'm sad".&nbsp; You have room for plenty of simultaneous emotions, and different ones can be directed at different things - being on a generally even keel about two different things isn't the same as being nervous about one and cheerful about the other, and neither state is the same as being entirely focused on one subject that thrills you to pieces.&nbsp; If you're nervous about your performance evaluation but tickled pink that you just bought a shiny new consumer good and looking forward to visiting your cousin next week yet irritated that you just stubbed your toe, all while being amused by the funny song on the radio, that's this.&nbsp; For the sake of the alphabet, I'm lumping in less emotionally laden cognition here, too - what thoughts occur to you, what chains of reasoning you follow, what parts of the environment catch your attention.<br><br>B stands for "behavior".&nbsp; Behavior here means <em>what you actually do</em>.&nbsp; Include as a dramatically lower-weighted category those things that you <em>fully intended to do</em>, and <em>actually moved to do</em>, but were then prevented from without from doing, or changed your mind about due to <em>new, unanticipated information</em>.&nbsp; This is critical.&nbsp; Fleeting designs and intentions cross our minds continually, and if you don't firmly and definitively place your evidential weight on the things that ultimately result in action, you will get subconsciously cherry-picked subsets of those incomplete plan-wisps.&nbsp; This is particularly problematic because weaker intentions will be dissuaded by minor environmental complications at a much higher rate.&nbsp; Don't worry overmuch about "real" plans that this filtering process discards.&nbsp; You're trying to know yourself <em>in toto</em>, not yourself at your best time-slices when you valiantly meant to do good thing X and were buffetted by circumstance: if those dismissed real plans represent typical dispositions you have, then they'll have their share of the cohort of actual behavior.&nbsp; Trust the law of averages.<br><br>C stands for "circumstance".&nbsp; This is what's going on around you (what time is it?&nbsp; what's going on in your life now and recently and in the near future - major events, minor upheavals, plans for later, what people say to you?&nbsp; where are you: is it warm, cold, bright, dim, windy, calm, quiet, noisy, aromatic, odorless, featureless, busy, colorful, drab, natural, artificial, pretty, ugly, spacious, cozy, damp, dry, deserted, crowded, formal, informal, familiar, new, cluttered, or tidy?).&nbsp; It also covers what you're doing and things inside you that are generally conceptualized as merely physical (are you exhausted, jetlagged, drugged, thirsty, hungry, sore, ill, drunk, energetic, itchy, limber, wired, shivering?&nbsp; are you draped over a recliner, hiding in a cellar, hangliding or dancing or hiking or drumming or hoeing or diving?)&nbsp; Circumstances are a bit easier to observe than affect and behavior.&nbsp; If you have trouble telling where you are and what you're up to, your first priority shouldn't be luminosity.&nbsp; And while we often have <em>some</em> trouble distinguishing between various physical ailments, there are strong pressures on our species to be able to tell when we're hungry or in <a href="/lw/14n/pain/">pain</a>.&nbsp; Don't neglect circumstance when performing correlative exercises just because it doesn't seem as "the contents of your skull"-y.&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder">SAD</a> should be evidence enough that our environments <em>can</em> profoundly influence our feelings.&nbsp; And wouldn't it be <em>weird</em>, after all, if you felt and acted just the same while ballroom dancing, and while setting the timer on your microwave oven to reheat soup, and while crouching on the floor after having been taken hostage at the bank?<a id="more"></a><br><br>All of these things are interdependent:</p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>A -&gt; B: Your affect influences your behavior most directly - affect, after all, captures what you're thinking and feeling, and apart from purely reflexive actions, you're going to act in response to that.</li> 
    <li>C -&gt; B: Circumstance also feeds very obviously into behavior.&nbsp; You cannot step on a gas pedal if there isn't one in front of you; you can't take a free sample of tapenade on a cracker if there aren't any to be had; and I've found it dreadfully tricky to start twirling my skirt around when I'm wearing yoga pants.</li> 
    <li>A -&gt; C: Affect can change your circumstances via your behavior, but also by altering what happens to your body's condition (we should all be familiar with how stress, for instance, can make you feel physically) and through your fellow human beings by virtue of nonverbal visibility.</li> 
    <li>B -&gt; C: Your behavior influences your circumstances, obviously - smash a window, and behold, there is a draft.&nbsp; Say something and the people around you will probably hear it and react.</li> 
    <li>B -&gt; A: Behavior can feed back into affect through hardwired two-way connections (smile and your emotions smile with you!) and through things like consistency effects, which make you become more like the person you seem to behaviorally emulate.</li> 
    <li>C -&gt; A: Your circumstances mess with your affect both consciously, through perception and knowledge ("it's my birthday!&nbsp; yay!"), and subconsciously, via physical effects (if you are operating on excessive sleep debt you will not be pleased with the results).</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p><br>So don't <em>just</em> correlate how they appear together: also note cause and effect relationships.&nbsp; Until you've developed enough luminosity to detect these things directly, you may have to fall back on a little post-hoc guesswork for connections more complicated than "I was hungry and thinking about cheese, so then I ate some cheese".&nbsp; Additionally, take note of any interesting <em>absences</em>.&nbsp; If something generally considered sad has happened to you, and you can detect no sadness in your affect or telltale physical side effects, that's highly relevant data.<br><br>These correlations will form the building blocks of your first pass of model refinement, proceeding from the priors you extracted from <a href="/lw/1xq/let_there_be_light/">external sources</a>.</p>

  <p>I see some clearly important categories highlighted here, and some possible relationships. Is there any advice on the (crucial) IMO question of what kind of format makes these observations compound in usefulness? Do you try to record every one that come to mind? Do you periodically (even on a timer perhaps) switch to introspection mode? Do you review notes, categorize them, track progress? Obviously I'd like to hear from Morendil who claimed a lot of progress in the area, of course others' contributions are most welcome.</p>

  </blockquote> 
  <p>This one (and the opposite, i.e. have an emotion where it's considered inappropriate) happens to me a lot.</p> 
  <p>For example, my room is usually total and utter chaos which doesn't disturb me in the slightest. For some reason anything that isn't moved in the last 3 or 4 days just becomes background, like trees in a forest. On the other hand, as a programmer, I tend to be very precise in my code &amp; database (Codd help you if I find that you forgot a foreign key).</p> 
  <p>Another one is weather and sunlight. I prefer an overcast sky and 10 - 20 degrees Celsius and truly hate summer. Travel is another one. I never got why people have to move over 500 miles to relax. Is it really that difficult to relax at home ?</p> 
  <p>About emotions in general, I never understood how people can consider them (in)appropriate. For the large part, I don't control how I feel so why is (not) feeling something my fault ? Off course, I mostly control how I react to those feelings so I'm still responsible for my behavior but if I simply say that I do/don't have an 'appropriate' feeling, why are some people always shocked ?</p>

  <p>I don't agree that circumstances are easily known at all. Most of my variation in pleasure is tied up in the uncertain territory of social interaction (because I'm materially well off); the remainder is in the unpredictable progress of my research or hobbies. While there are moments of unequivocal (in)validation, most of the time the outcome is in doubt.</p> 
  <p>It's fun playing around at such a high level of abstraction as you do in this post. Everything you discuss is obviously true, but it's pleasant how you've packaged it.</p> 
  <p>In general, I find heuristics for focusing my attention other than where it falls naturally to be interesting only as novelties - soon I'm back to paying attention to whatever strikes me.</p> 
  <p>There's a fun exercise I read about in a how-to-act book (aside: aspiring actors seem like a surprisingly large market): either aloud with a partner, or to yourself, say how every little thing you experience makes you feel. Clearly you weren't doing that when you drafted this article; you were absorbed in the object you were manipulating. Self-awareness seems most important when what you're manipulating is your own affect.</p> 
  <p>I can entertain time-consuming meditative or introspective exercises to the extent I hope that I'll gain some permanent, low-maintenance benefit, like learning new information that will be useful without constant recitation, or forming more effective habits (in behavior or what I attend to).</p>

  <p>Very true. William James is not likely the most popular cove on LW, but nonetheless:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p>Thus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if our spontaneous cheerfulness be lost, is to sit up cheerfully, to look round cheerfully, and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there. If such conduct does not make you soon feel cheerful, nothing else on that occasion can. So to feel brave, act as if we were brave, use all our will to that end, and a courage-fit will very likely replace the fit of fear. Again, in order to feel kindly toward a person to whom we have been inimical, the only way is more or less deliberately to smile, to make sympathetic inquiries, and to force ourselves to say genial things. One hearty laugh together will bring enemies into a closer communion of heart than hours spent on both sides in inward wrestling with the mental demon of uncharitable feeling. To wrestle with a bad feeling only pins our attention on it, and keeps it still fastened in the mind: whereas, if we act as if from some better feeling, the old bad feeling soon folds its tent like an Arab, and silently steals away.</p>

  <p>It's a commonplace among people who give up dieting that it can take months to learn to tell whether they're hungry-- they've overlaid the information from their bodies thoughts about whether they ought to feel hungry and whether they're going to permit themselves to eat.</p> 
  <p>I suspect that, considering the amount of social pressure about many feelings (sexual attraction and anger are what comes to mind), a two-pronged attack might be appropriate-- both paying more attention to one's experience and considering whether one has accepted ideas about what one ought to be feeling.</p>

  <p><strong>2. Widgets</strong></p> 
  <p>Tony's performance at work is suffering. Not every day, but most days, he's too drained and distracted to perform the tasks that go into making widgets. He's in serious danger of falling behind his widget quota and needs to figure out why. Having just read a fascinating and brilliantly written post on Less Wrong about luminosity, he decides to keep track of where he is and what he's doing when he does and doesn't feel the drainedness. After a week, he's got a fairly robust correlation: he feels worst on days when he doesn't eat breakfast, which reliably occurs when he's stayed up too late, hit the snooze button four times, and had to dash out the door. Awkwardly enough, having been distracted all day tends to make him work more slowly at making widgets, which makes him less physically exhausted by the time he gets home and enables him to stay up later. To deal with that, he starts going for long runs on days when his work hasn't been very tiring, and pops melatonin; he easily drops off to sleep when his head hits the pillow at a reasonable hour, gets sounder sleep, scarfs down a bowl of Cheerios, and arrives at the widget factory energized and focused.</p>

  <p>I fear I may be exceptionally dim even on this metric - I often find myself deducing that I should be hungry before feeling hunger. I think I might do well to start in on the previous and this step quite soon.</p>
