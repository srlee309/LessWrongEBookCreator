   <p><em>Luminosity is fun, useful to others, and important in self-improvement.&nbsp; You should learn about it with this sequence.</em></p> 
   <p>Luminosity?&nbsp; Pah!&nbsp; Who needs it?<br><br>It's a legitimate question.&nbsp; The typical human gets through life with astonishingly little introspection, much less careful, accurate introspection.&nbsp; Our models of ourselves are sometimes even worse than our models of each other - we have more data, but also more biases loading up our reflection with noise.&nbsp; Most of the time, most people act on their emotions and beliefs directly, without the interposition of self-aware deliberation.&nbsp; And this doesn't usually seem to get anyone maimed or killed - when was the last time a gravestone read "Here Lies Our Dear Taylor, Who Might Be Alive Today With More Internal Clarity About The Nature Of Memory Retrieval"?&nbsp; Nonsense.&nbsp; If Taylor needs to remember something, it'll present itself, or not, and if there's a chronic problem with the latter then Taylor can export memories to <a href="/lw/11f/the_great_brain_is_located_externally/">the environment</a>.&nbsp; Figuring out how the memories are stored in the first place and tweaking that is not high on the to-do list.<br><br>Still, I think it's worth investing considerable time and effort into improving your luminosity.&nbsp; I submit three reasons why this is so.<a id="more"></a><br><br>First, you are a fascinating creature.&nbsp; It's just plain fun and rewarding to delve into your own mind.&nbsp; People in general are among the most complex, intriguing things in the world.&nbsp; You're no less so.&nbsp; You have lived a fair number of observer-moments.&nbsp; Starting with a native architecture that is pretty special all by itself, you've accumulated a complex set of filters by which you interpret your input - remembered past, experienced present, and anticipated future.&nbsp; You like things; you want things; you believe things; you expect things; you feel things.&nbsp; There's a lot of stuff rolled up and tucked into the fissures of your brain.&nbsp; Wouldn't you like to know what it is?&nbsp; Particularly because it's <em>you</em>.&nbsp; Many people find themselves to be their favorite topics.&nbsp; Are you an exception?&nbsp; (There's one way to find out...)<br><br>Second, an accurate model of yourself can help you help others deal with you in the best possible way.&nbsp; Right now, they're probably using kludgey agglomerations of self-projection, stereotype, and automatically generated guesses that they may not bother to update as they learn more about you.&nbsp; I'm assuming you don't surround yourself with hostile people who would use accurate data about you to hurt and manipulate you, but if you do, certainly be judicious with whatever information your quest for luminosity supplies.&nbsp; As for everyone else, their having a better model of you will avoid a lot of headaches on everyone's parts.&nbsp; I'll present myself as an example: I hate surprises.&nbsp; Knowing this, and being able to tell a complete and credible story about how this works, I can explain to people who might wish to exchange gifts why they should not spring unknown wrapped items on me, and avoid that source of irritation.&nbsp; Most of the people around me choose not to take actions that they know will irritate me; but without a detailed explanation of exactly <em>how</em> my preferences are uncommon, they'll all too easily revert to their base model of a generic person.<br><br>Third, and most germane to the remaining posts in this sequence: with a better picture of who you are and what your brain is up to, you can find the best low-hanging fruit in terms of hacks to <em>change</em> yourself.&nbsp; If you keep going from point A to point Z, but know nothing about the route in between, then the only way you can avoid a disliked Z is to try to come to a screeching halt right before it happens.&nbsp; If you could monitor the process from the start, and determine what pattern your mind follows along the alphabet, you might find that you can easily intervene at G or Q, and never have to deal with Z again.&nbsp; Similarly, if you try to go from alpha to omega but tend not to wind up at omega, how are you ever going to determine where your obstructions lie unless you pay attention to something other than the bare fact of non-omega?&nbsp; There could be some trivial omicron-related problem that you'd fix in a heartbeat if only you knew it was getting in the way.&nbsp; Additionally, your faulty models of yourself are <em>already changing you</em> through such miraculous means as cognitive dissonance.&nbsp; Unless you find out how it's doing that, you lose the chance to monitor and control the process.<br><br>An analogy: You're waiting to be picked up at the airport.&nbsp; The designated time comes and goes, and you're sitting by the baggage claim with your suitcases at your feet, your eyes on your watch, and a frown on your face.&nbsp; The person was supposed to pick you up <em>at the airport</em>, and isn't there!&nbsp; A clear failure has occurred!&nbsp; But if you phone the person and start screaming "The airport, you fool!&nbsp; I'm at the airport!&nbsp; Why aren't you?" then this will tend not to improve things unless the person never left in the first place out of forgetfulness.&nbsp; If they're stuck in traffic, or were sent out of their way by road construction, or have gotten hopelessly lost, or have been identified by the jackbooted thugs that keep watch at the airport parking lot as a terrorist, reiterating that you had this particular goal in mind won't help.&nbsp; And unless you <em>find out what is keeping them</em>, you can't help.&nbsp; You have to know where they are to tell them what detours to take to avoid rush hour; you have to know what diversions were introduced to tell them how to rejoin their planned route; you have to know what landmarks they can see to know where they've gone missing to; you have to know whether to go make Bambi eyes at the security guards and plead misunderstanding.&nbsp; Without rather specific, sensitive data about what's gone wrong, you can't make it right.<br><br>In the next posts of this sequence, I'm going to illustrate some methods that have helped me learn more about myself and change what I don't like.&nbsp; With luck, they'll assist you on the project that I've just attempted to convince you to want to undertake.</p>

  <p>From the introductory post:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p>I have some reason to believe that I am substantially more luminous than average, because I can ask people what seem to me to be perfectly easy questions about what they're thinking and find them unable to answer.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Based on this idea, could you write some kind of luminosity diagnostic? It seems like people would be more likely to want to change if they knew what they're missing (I know I would).</p>

  <p>tl;dr: Why study yourself? Because</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>You're interesting because you're complicated and you're <em>you</em>.</li> 
   <li>You can convincingly ask people to adjust how they deal with you to your peculiarities.</li> 
   <li>You can learn how to improve yourself and thus accomplish your goals.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>Fair summary?</p> 
  <p>Would you say that improved self awareness can help you accomplish your goals directly, without the self-modification discussed in reason #3? Something like: learn more about what makes you happy, then do that stuff. This seems like a bigger payoff than #2 to me, worthy of inclusion in any sales pitch for self-study.</p>

  <p>I find that introspecting tends to makes me feel bad, because I don't feel as though I am the way I "should" be - but I don't really want to be the way I feel obligated to be. So I try very hard not to think about it, because when I'm not thinking about it, I'm not experiencing any distress.</p>

  <p>It's a funny, though in retrospect unsurprising, coincidence that you're using a light-related metaphor. For a while, I was intending to write about "phenomenal transparency", especially <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=COYWQ_7Nla4C&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=%22being%20no-one%22%20transparency&amp;hl=fi&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q=%22being%20no-one%22%20transparency&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">as used by Thomas Metzinger</a>. He quotes an early <a href="http://www.ditext.com/moore/refute.html" rel="nofollow">paper</a> by the philosopher G.E. Moore, who spoke of the fact that while we can see e.g. the color blue, we cannot see what it is that <em>makes</em> it blue.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p>And in general, that which makes the sensation of blue a mental fact seems to escape us; it seems, if I may use a metaphor, to be transparent - we look through it and see nothing but the blue; we may be convinced that there is <em>something</em>, but <em>what</em> it is no philosopher, I think, has yet clearly recognized.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Metzinger notes that the most philosophers now use "transparency" to mean that the "content properties" of our mental states are available for introspection, but not their "vehicle properties". However, he finds this definition unsatisfactory and offers his own:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p>Transparency in this sense is a property of active mental representations already satisfying the minimally sufficient constraints for conscious experience to occur. [...] The second defining characteristic postulates that what makes them transparent is <em>attentional unavailability of earlier processing stages</em> for introspection. [...] What is attention? In short, attention is a form of nonconceptual metarepresentation operating on certain parts of the currently active, internal model of reality. It "highlights" these parts, because it is a process of subsymbolic resource allocation. The earlier the processing stages, the more aspects of the internal construction process leading to the final, explicit and disambiguated phenomenal content that are available for introspective attention, the more will the system be able to recognize these phenomenal states <em>as</em> internal, self-generated constructs. Full transparency means full attentional unavailability of earlier processing stages. Degrees of opacity comes as degrees of attentional availability.</p> 
   <p><strong>Definition 2</strong> For any phenomenal state, the degree of phenomenal transparency is inversely proportional to the introspective degree of attentional availability of earlier processing stages.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In other words, the processes in our mind that we are unable to perceive, we take as givens. Were we able to perceive e.g. the way our visual cortex constructed images, or the way our cognitive subsystems constructed beliefs, we'd realize them to be constructions and not take them so easily for granted.</p> 
  <p>I've been meaning to write more about this, but have never gotten around it.</p>

  <p>I like this post, but it feels like it's missing something to motivate the clever title. You didn't seem to identify a "grue" (presumably, some horrible consequence from not being luminous), which doesn't seem terribly difficult to do in this case. Perhaps it doesn't belong in this post, but surely the title demands one.</p> 
  <p>Also, is "luminous" a modifier for beliefs, people, or both? Should there be two different words? Did I miss that discussion along the way?</p>

  <p>You appear to be claiming that introspection is: a good route to self-knowledge / better understanding ones mental processes; an effective way to develop a more accurate model of your own behaviour and a good (possibly the best?) source of information to guide effective attempts at self improvement or self modification.</p> 
  <p>These are all highly controversial claims in psychology and the balance of evidence I've seen leads me to conclude that it is likely that introspection is <em>not</em> a good route to self-knowledge and that it is a poor basis for attempts at self improvement. I've seen a compelling <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Strangers-Ourselves-Discovering-Adaptive-Unconscious/dp/0674013824/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1268849669&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">case</a> made that the best way to understand ones own behaviour is to attempt to observe yourself 'from the outside' rather than relying on introspection - you will form a more accurate model attempting to ignore data that derives from introspection and instead judging yourself the way you would judge others based on externally visible actions.</p> 
  <p>Will you be addressing the standard criticisms of introspection as a source of knowledge as part of this sequence or are you assuming it for the purposes of this sequence? I'm interested to see how the sequence unfolds but I'm concerned that you don't seem to be addressing the controversial status of introspection as a valid source of knowledge.</p>

  <p>The reason I perform introspection is because I like closing doors. Every question I've answered to a satisfactory degree is a closed door, and the more I close, the more complete everything seems. Questions about the self and other complex topics in first order philosophy are particularly interesting, and great fun to pursue.</p>

  <p>I'm rather happy with my Zs and omegas, but some of my dear ones aren't.</p> 
  <p>I expect that this sequence will allow me to give them more educated suggestions about how to fix themselves up, but based on past experience, they will most likely nod in agreement, yet go on using the dysfunctional coping method they've been using for years.

  <p>Suppose you're extremely powerful. Then the only self-knowledge you need is about what most pleases you. If it turns out that additional self-knowledge is what pleases you, great.</p> 
  <p>Suppose you're extremely weak. You can barely stay alive; self-knowledge is useful when it can help you stay healthy, and useless when it merely spends glucose without any material reward.</p> 
  <p>Between those extremes, it seems like increased self-knowledge might be pleasing or empowering (depending on the specific individual+circumstances). But I think that when it's actively sought, it's hard to sift the truth from the confabulation.</p> 
  <p>I've always been interested in knowing and improving my habits and tendencies. It seems like what I'm passively aware of shows just a small portion of my present brain state, and whatever more I can actively trace is disappointingly little.</p>

  <p>I think luminosity is very important as making conscious and self aware decisions instead of simply responding to external stimuli mindlessly is what seperates humans from being a very complex robot. The more conscious we are the better decisions we can make as we can analyze our thought processes and eliminate biases and emotional flaws in our thinking. In my opinion, consciousness and rationality are directly proportional in humans. In short, any human who wants to become a more rational thinker would be well advised to take steps to increase their consciousness or luminosity if you want to call it that. That is certainly what I am trying to do. Great series by the way.</p>
