 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Noble gentlemen and ladies in [Japanâ€™s] Heian period (794-1185) were often remarkably promiscuous. â€¦ â€œHeian society was on the whole governed by style rather than by any moral principles, and good looks tended to take the place of virtue.â€� â€¦ It was, as all this suggests, a rather effete culture. The aristocratic ideal of male beautyâ€”highly perfumed, moon-faced, smooth-skinned, extravagantly dressedâ€”was close to the feminine ideal. A distinct air of decadence during the peak of the Heian period also suggests the approaching end of a regime, a world, in Genjiâ€™s words, â€œwhere everything seems to be in a state of decline.â€�</p> 
 <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Less than two hundred years later, the self-obsessed nobility of the Heian court, distracted by the rituals and refinements of palace politics, oblivious of the world outside the capital, and mostly bored out of their minds, were overwhelmed by more vigorous provincial clans, notably the samurai, with their warrior codes and martial ideals. But in Genjiâ€™s time, the early eleventh century, the imperial capital (todayâ€™s Kyoto) still held sway; anyone unlucky enough to live in the provinces was considered too uncouth to be taken seriously.

 <p>This seems a familiar history story, that elite self-indulgence and moral decadence causes social decay and displacement. It contributes toÂ&nbsp;the <em>Hunger Games</em> stories, for example. It also seems a common foundation ofÂ&nbsp;conservative thought. But, is it <em>true</em>? I ask because I actually do not know. Has anyone done statistical tests on systematic historical datasets to see if decadence actually causes decay and displacement? I could imagine counter arguments, such as that decadence promotes peace instead of destructive war-mongering. So Iâ€™d prefer not to have to rely only on a few anecdotes and one plausible intuition.</p>

 <p>I was going to point this out. A run of almost 400 years compares pretty favorably to most longer-term monarchical systems like the Chinese dynasties, the Roman Empire, the Caliphates, or the later Shogunate. Only one data point, of course, but the Heian regime would indicate “decadence” in that sense doesn’t have much to do with a regime’s longevity or stability.</p>

 <p>It may be easier to test the inverse by looking at immigrant groups within the U.S. Do less decadent groups outperform more decadent groups? I’d imagine so. If that’s the case, then I’d be more comfortable saying an absence of these virtues leads to decline.</p> 
 <p>“Declines” are infrequent enough that I don’t expect to know much about them. We have less large declines than we have theories that might explain declines. For example:</p>

 <p>I would think that decadence-seeking immigrants will economically outperform the ones who are satisfied with a humble (less decadent) lifestyle. Widespread public decadence – a hunger for fineries like silk, books and opera – seen from a different perspective is nothing more than the rise of the middle class. It’s the people who couldn’t care less about fashion, Tolstoy and vintage wines who underperform.</p>

 <p>I think there are too many issues here to track. One is the divergence between the manners of the rulers and the ruled, which seems to be the Heian story, Marie Antoinette, Anthony and Cleopatra drinking wine with crushed pearls, etc. Yeah, that rarely ends well, put the problem is not the decadence as such, but the inequality and the discontent caused by it. The court in Paris would have been beloved if the French peasants were upwardly mobile enough to emulate at least some of the courtly indulgences. The Habsburgs were pretty damn decadent, but because Austrians were getting richer, they arguably served as aspirational figures.</p> 
 <p>Another issue is that civilizations have their peaks and declines, and the post-peak period is often labeled as decadent, but this is always done in hindsight. That’s because the peak generated wealth that gets turned into comforts and luxuries, and these seem decadent only because we know with hindsight that things had started falling apart. We also ignore decadent figures like Nero and Caligula who ruled while Rome was still going strong.</p> 
 <p>Then there is the sense of decadence which implies executive laziness and indifference, which may have been the case in the Heian period. But laziness can be caused by many things, not only decadence. GW Bush is an example of non-decadent laziness in power, while Franz Josef’s court in Vienna was decadent but governed diligently.</p> 
 <p>I suspect that what we would find is that what’s really bad is not decadence as such, but an extreme and unbridgable inequality between the ruling and the ruled. The two are related, but not the same.</p>

 <p>It could be that decadance “fails” precisely because it promotes peace instead of destructive war mongering. That is, it is all good, until some successful, destructive war mongers come and end the party. </p> 
 <p>That opens the question of whether the rules have changed: sometime after the invention of gunpoweder, low-tech barbarians stopped being able to occasionally kick the ***t out of more developed cultures. Maybe the decadance penalty is obsolete.</p>

 <p>“..decadence promotes peace instead of destructive war-mongering.”</p> 
 <p>Rather than a counter argument, that’s precisely the mechanism by which decadence causes decay. Decay is the same as peacefulness and prosperity. When people talk about the Romans decaying or the Byzantines decaying, they are talking about people losing their toughness and ability to fight. Decadence is peaceful trade, prosperity, and being pampered. Then the Mongols come in and kill everyone because the decadent society was getting fat on fancy food instead of being in the wilderness wrestling bears.</p>

 <p>I think Gibbon really started this with his analysis of The Rise and Fall of the Roman Republic, which blame the fall on Christianity’s pacifism. The problem is, early heroes like Cincinnatus seem tougher, but they were building an empire, so builders would have to be. A maintainer is almost forced to be less masculine. It could be an ex post selection bias.</p> 
 <p>So, if you look at who presides over growing vs. shrinking empires, you’ll find tough vs. effete stereotypes, but perhaps not in periods of stasis.</p>

 <p>Two components of Heian decadence are described: loss of virtue (style over morality) and loss of virility. </p> 
 <p>A question for students of history: what is the degree of correlation between the two? Are these two aspects of one process? Or is their coexistence in Heian Japan historically contingent?</p>

 <p>In that decadence is noteworthy in a society, it is noticed by those who do not have entrenched privilege, whose existence implies inefficiencies in the social economy. Inefficiency invites decline and conquest. The decadence is only a symptom of that inefficiency.</p> 
 <p>For a thought experiment on decadence without inefficiency, see the Culture novels of Iain M. Banks. The society is decadent because of efficiency and a lack of entrenched privilege. As a result, it is remarkably resilient rather than in decline. Yes, I know this is fiction, but as a thought experiment it is relatively robust.</p>
